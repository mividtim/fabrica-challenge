## Getting Started

#### Go, and the asdf version manager
To use this tutorial, you must have an installation of Go installed. There is a `.tool-versions` file included,
which is pre-set with the `golang` version that the author used when developing this code. The author uses the
[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) version manager to manage different tool versions for each repository on his system.
`asdf` shims the shell commands for the proper tool versions for each repository as he changes the present working
directory.
